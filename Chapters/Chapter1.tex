Current practical implementations make compatibility and performance 
tradeoffs, and as a result it is possible to automatically harden 
existing exploits to bypass these defenses. This research work 
demonstrates the defenses as currently deployed can be bypassed with new 
techniques for automatically creating \emph{ROP} payloads from small amounts of 
nonrandomized code. The research paper proposes a semantic program 
verification techniques for identifying the functionality of gadgets, and 
design a \emph{ROP} compiler that is resistant to missing gadget types. In the 
research work, the authors have build \emph{Q}, an end-to-end system that 
automatically generates \emph{ROP} payloads for a given binary.

\section{Writable $\oplus$ eXecutable}

\subsection{Advantages}
Attackers have traditionally included shellcode (executable machine code) 
in their exploits as payloads. Since shellcode must be written to memory 
at runtime, it cannot be executed because of the $W \oplus X$ property. The 
main limitation of $W \oplus X$ is that it only prevents an attacker from 
utilizing new payload code

\subsection{Limitations}
The attacker can still reuse existing code in memory. Eg: 
\emph{return-to-libc} attack.

\subsection{Implementation}
Hardware level using $NX$ bit could be enabled through $PAE$ addressing mode.

\section{ASLR}

\subsection{Advantages}
$ASLR$ prevents an attacker from directly referring to objects in memory 
by randomizing their locations. This stops an attacker from being able 
to transfer control to his shellcode by hardcoding its address in his 
exploit.

\subsection{Limitations}
Some attacks on $ASLR$ implementations take advantage of the low entropy
available for randomization. Where as $ret2reg$ attacks, allow the 
attacker to transfer control to their payload by utilizing pointers 
leaked in registers or memory.

\section{Return Oriented Programming}
$ROP$ is a generalization of the $return-to-libc$ attack. In a 
$return-to-libc$ attack, the attacker reuses entire functions from $libc$. 
With $ROP$, the attacker uses instruction sequences found in memory, 
called $gadgets$, and chains them together. $ROP$ attacks are desirable 
because they allow the attacker to perform computations beyond the 
functions of $libc$ (or whatever code is nonrandomized). This is 
especially important in the context of modern systems, because the 
nonrandomized code may not contain useful functions for the attacker.
