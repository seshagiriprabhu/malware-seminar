\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof to show that existing $ASLR$ and $W \oplus X$ implementations 
    do not provide adequate protection by developing automated techniques to 
    bypass them.
    \item New ideas to scale $ROP$ to small code bases. $ROP$ techniques for 
    small, nonrandomized code bases as found in most practical exploit settings. 
    \item Evaluation of the techniques in an end-to-end system, proving the 
    insufficient security of the existing defenses.
    \item Semantic gadget arrangement used in this research work is one of 
    the novel technique. Efficiency of $Q$ is more as randomized testing is enabled.
\end{itemize}
