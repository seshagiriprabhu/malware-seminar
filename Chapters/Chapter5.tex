\section{Conclusion}
The research work is able to develop a unique technique to synthesize robust $ROP$ exploits 
which could bypass the current $ROP$ defences including $W \oplus X$ and $ASLR$ for binaries 
sized above $20KB$ with a success rate of $80\%$.  $Q$ is one of the research outcome, which 
could be used to harden exploit in-order to bypass OS defences. This research work points out
dangers in the current operating systems which doesn't have complete randomized code which 
leads to the bypass of $ROP$ defences when there is a vulnerability in the programs.
